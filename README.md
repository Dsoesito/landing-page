# Landing Page

Hi There! This is a custom landing page I created that shows the time, local weather, and a custom message üòÅ

I enjoyed this app so much I made it my custom landing page on all my broswers!!

App Link: https://dsoesito.github.io/landing-page/
** Feel free to view this app on your phone! It is mobile friendly**

## Features

- Digital clock that displays time, in seconds
- Weather section that shows weather in your area (assuming you allow location services)
- Weather icon changes according to current weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Custom messages that will remain as long as cached memory is stored in browser

## Architecture

This is a very simple app built only with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API. All data is taken from the OpenWeather API. Based on the received data, the icon beneath the temperature will change. The custon messages at the bottom are stored in the browser cache and will remain until cleared. Lastly, the background of the landing page also changes based on the time of day, to further customize the look and feel.
